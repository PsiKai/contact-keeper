# Contact Keeper Application

A tutorial-driven, full-stack application for users to keep and create contact information for their roll-o-dex.

## Technology Stack

- MongoDb
- Express
- React.js
- Node.js

## Description of Application

The purpose of this project was to learn how to create full-stack applications with React. In additional, I also learned how to manage global app state with the Context API, how to encrypt passwords with JSON Web Token, and how to make relationships between databases in MongoDb.

The user will either login or register a new account, and their contact list will be brought up. A form allows them to add new contacts, and a searchbar allows them to filter through existing contacts to view and make changes.

## Hosting

As a tutorial project, it was deployed to a free dyno on Heroku, and as such it is will fall asleep and take about 10-15 seconds to boot up again when visiting. Having said that, here is the link: https://murmuring-shore-76543.herokuapp.com/login
